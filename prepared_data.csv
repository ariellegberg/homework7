my tlc was quite od, id my facts (id my)
now pov of you and me, similar iraq
i don't hate you, but i hate to critique, overrate you
these beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
take time and erase you, love don't hear no more, no, i don't fear no more
better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

and by mornin', gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean

[verse 2]
there was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
when the butterflies turnеd to dust that covered my whole room
so i punchеd a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[pre-chorus]
the water filled my lungs
i screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing

[verse 1]
you stand with your hand on my waistline
it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
it's a bad sign, bad sign
somethin' happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circlin', dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
it could burn out

[pre-chorus]
'cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
they are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

[chorus]
baby, i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'cause i, i know places we can hide
i know places, i know places

[verse 2]
lights flash and we'll run for the fences
let them say what they want, we won't hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time

[pre-chorus]
just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
they are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

once the flight had flown (uh-huh)
with the wilt of the rose (uh-huh)
i slept all alone (uh-huh)
you still wouldn't go

[pre-chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
i see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
you dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[chorus]
was it over when she laid down on your couch?
was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""come here,"" i whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passеd out, baby
was it over then? and is it over now?

[post-chorus]
(is it? is it? is it?)

[verse 2]
whеn you lost control (uh-huh)
red blood, white snow (uh-huh)
blue dress on a boat (uh-huh)
your new girl is my clone

[bridge]
and did you think i didn't see you?
there were flashin' lights
at least i had the decency
to keep my nights out of sight
only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
and my whispered sighs
oh, lord, i think about jumpin'
off of very tall somethings
just to see you come runnin'
and say the one thing i've been wanting, but no

[pre-chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (oh)
if she's got blue eyes, i will surmise that you'll probably date her (oh, no)
you dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (oh)
you search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[chorus]
was it over when she laid down on your couch?
was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""come here,"" i whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out, baby

and say the one thing (oh, lord)
i've been wanting (oh, lord)
but no it's 2 am in your car
windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
you say, ""it's in the past,"" you drive straight ahead
you're thinkin' that i hate you now
'cause you still don't know what i never said

[chorus]
i wish you would come back
wish i never hung up the phone like i did, i
wish you knew that
i'll never forget you as long as i live and i
wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
i wish you would

[verse 2]
it's 2 am in my room
headlights pass the window pane, i think of you
we're a crooked love in a straight line down
makes you want to run and hide
then it makes you turn right back around

wish i never hung up the phone like i did, i
wish you knew that

we wait for trains that just aren't comin'
we show off our different scarlet letters
trust me, mine is better
we're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
we play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
honey, life is just a classroom
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and evеry day is like a battle
but evеry night with us is like a dream
baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free

[verse 2]
we're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
we hang back, it's all in the timing
it's poker, he can't see it in my face
but i'm about to play my ace, ah
we need love, but all we want is danger
we team up, then switch sides like a record changer
the rumors are terrible and cruel
but, honey, most of them are true
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[chorus]
'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle

heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancin' (yeah) to get knocked off our feet (hey)
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free

baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancin' (hey) to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free you went to a party
i heard from everybody
you part the crowd like the red sea
don't even get me started
did you get anxious though
on the way home?
i guess i'll never, ever know
now that we don't talk

[verse 2]
you grew your hair long
you got new icons
and from the outside
it looks like you're tryin' lives on
i miss the old ways
you didn't have to change
but i guess i don't have a say
now that we don't talk

[chorus]
i call my mom, she said that it was for the best
remind myself, the morе i gave, you'd want me less
i cannot bе your friend, so i pay the price of what i lost
and what it cost, now that we don't talk

[bridge]
what do you tell your friends we
shared dinners, long weekends with?
truth is, i can't pretend it's
platonic, it's just ended, so

[chorus]
i call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (off my chest)
remind myself the way you faded 'til i left (until i left)
i cannot be your friend, so i pay the price of what i lost (of what i lost)
and what it cost, now that we don't talk

[outro]
i don't have to pretend i like acid rock
or that i'd like to be on a mega yacht
with important men who think important thoughts
guess maybe i am better off now that we don't talk
and the only way back to my dignity
was to turn into a shrouded mystery
just like i had been when you were chasing me
guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk looking at it now
it all seems so simple
we were lying on your couch
i remember
you took a polaroid of us
then discovered (then discovered)
the rest of the world was black and white
but we were in screaming color
and i remember thinkin'

[chorus]
are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods?
are we in the clear yet? are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? good
are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods?
are we in the clear yet? are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? good
(are we out of the woods?)

[verse 2]
looking at it now
last december (last december)
we were built to fall apart
and fall back together (back together)
ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
the night we couldn't quite forget
when we decided, we decided
to move the furniture so we could dance
baby, like we stood a chance
two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
and i remember thinkin'

[chorus]
are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods?
are we in the clear yet? are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? good
are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods yet? (oh)
are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods?
are we in the clear yet? are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? good
(are we out of the woods?)

[bridge]
remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
twenty stitches in the hospital room
when you started crying, baby, i did too
but when the sun came up, i was lookin' at you
remember when we couldn't take the heat?
i walked out, i said, ""i'm settin' you free""
but the monsters turned out to be just trees
when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
you were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me
(are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods yet?)
(are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods?)
i remember
(are we in the clear yet? are we in the clear yet?)
(are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? good)
oh, i remember
[chorus]

are we in the clear yet? are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? good i've known it from the very start
we're a shot in the darkest dark
oh no, oh no, i'm unarmed
the waiting is a sadness
fading into madness
oh no, oh no, it won't stop

i'm standin' on a tightrope alone
i hold my breath a little bit longer
halfway out the door, but it won't close
i'm holdin' out hope for you to

say, ""don't go""
i would stay forever if you say, ""don't go""

[chorus]
why'd you have to lead me on?
why'd you have to twist the knife?
walk away and leave me bleedin', bleedin'?
why'd you whisper in the dark?
just to leave me in the night?
now your silence has me screamin', screamin'

[post-chorus]

[verse 2]
now i'm pacin' on shaky ground
strike a match, then you blow it out
oh no, oh no, it's not fair
'cause you kiss mе and it stops time
and i'm yours, but you're not mine
oh no, oh no, you're not there

[refrain]
i'm standin' on the sidewalk alone
i wait for you to drive by

handprints in wet cement
adorned with smoke on my clothes
lovelorn and nobody knows
love thorns all over this rose
i'll pay the price, you won't

they might as well be lookin' at us
and if they call me a slut
you know it might be worth it for once
and if i'm gonna be drunk
i might as well be drunk in love

[verse 2]
send the code, he's waitin' there
the sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
everyone wants him, that was my crime
the wrong place at the right time
and i break down, then he's pullin' me in
in a world of boys, he's a gentleman

[pre-chorus]
got love-struck, went straight to my head (straight to my head)

neon light, this is luxury

i should just tell you to leave 'cause i
know exactly where it leads, but i
watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[chorus]
you got that james dean daydream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'cause we nеver go out of style, we nеver go out of style
you got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
and when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[verse 2]

'cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style you had people who called you on unmarked numbers
in my peripheral vision
i let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
all was quickly forgiven
you were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
flush with the currency of cool
i was always turnin' out my empty pockets
and when it came to you

[chorus]
i didn't come here to make friends
we were born to be suburban legends
when you hold me, it holds me together
and you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

[verse 2]
i had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
would surprise the whole school
when i ended up back at our class reunion
walkin' in with you
you'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
with the pages ripped out
i am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
and i can still see you now

[chorus]
i didn't come here to make friends
we were born to be suburban legends
when you hold me, it holds me together
and you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
i know that you still remember
we were born to be national treasures
when you told me we'd get back together
and you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh, ayy
seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
wish i could make it better, someday, you won't remember
this pain you thought would last forever and ever and

we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh

[post-chorus]
in wonderland, eh, eh
in wonderland
in wonderland, woah
in wonderland
[bridge]
i reached for you, but you were gone
i knew i had to go back home
you searched the world for somethin' else
to make you feel like what we had
and in the end, in wonderland, we both went mad
oh

[chorus]
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever (could last forever)
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it (got lost in it)
and life was never worse, but never better (never better)
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it (in wonderland)
and we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it (in wonderland)
and life was never worse, but never better
in wonderland one look, dark room, meant just for you
time moved too fast, you play it back
buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
no proof, not much, but you saw enough
small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
the light reflects the chain on your neck
he says, ""look up"" and your shoulders brush
no proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[chorus]
you can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
you can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
you can see it with the lights out (see it with the lights out), lights out (lights out)
you are in love, true love, you are in lovе

[verse 2]
morning, his place, burnt toast, sunday
you keep his shirt, he keeps his word
and for once, you lеt go of your fears and your ghosts
one step, not much, but it said enough
you kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk
one night, he wakes, strange look on his face
pauses, then says, ""you're my best friend""
and you knew what it was, he is in love

[chorus]
you can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
you can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
you can see it with the lights out (see it with the lights out), lights out (lights out)
you are in love, true love, you are in love

[bridge]
and so it goes
you two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now
why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

[interlude]
'cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love, true love, you are in love

[chorus]
you can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
you can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
you can see it with the lights out (see it with the lights out), lights out (lights out)
you are in love, true love, you are in love (ah)
you can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you (ah)
you can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you (ah)
you can see it with the lights out (see it with the lights out), lights out (lights out)
you are in love, true love, you are in love"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"i see your face in my mind as i drive away
'cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
people are people and sometimes we change our minds
but it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[break: taylor swift]
mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

[verse 2: taylor swift with colbie caillat]
the music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
it's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
now i don't know what to be without you around

[pre-chorus: taylor swift with colbie caillat]
and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand

[chorus: taylor swift with colbie caillat]
and i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to

[verse 3: taylor swift with colbie caillat]
never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
every little bump in the road, i tried to swerve
but people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
and nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout

[pre-chorus: taylor swift with colbie caillat]
and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand

and i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to

[bridge: taylor swift with colbie caillat]

i'm sorry, (yeah, yeah) i'm sorry
i'm sorry, i'm sorry (ooh, ooh)
i'm sorry it wasn't just like a movie
the rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
i'm drivin' away and i, i guess you could say
this is the last time i'll drive this way again
lost in the gray and i try to grab at the fray
'cause i, i still love you, but i can't

[chorus]
bye, bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
bye, bye, baby
bye, bye, baby

[verse 2]
the picture frame is empty
on the dresser, vacant just like me
i see your writing on the dash
then back to your hesitation
i was so sure of everything
everything i thought we'd always have
guess i never doubted it
then the here and the now floods in
feels like i'm becoming a part of your past

[chorus]
bye, bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
bye, bye, baby

[bridge]
and there's so much that i can't touch
you're all i want, but it's not enough this time
and all the pages are just slipping through my hands
and i'm so scared of how this ends

[chorus]
bye, bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you bad, but it's come down to nothing

oh, you took me home, i thought you were gonna keep me
bye, bye, baby
bye, bye, baby well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know it's all the same, another time and place
repeating history and you're getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and i'll do anything to see it through

[chorus]
because these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
and we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
oh, oh

[verse 2]
so we've been outnumbered, raidеd, and now cornered
it's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair
we're getting stronger now, find things they never found
they might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
you can walk away, say we don't need this
but there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[chorus]
'cause these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
and we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
oh, oh

[bridge]
tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
fight for what we've worked for all these years
and the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
but we'll stand up champions tonight

[chorus]
it was the night things changed
can you see it now?
when the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
it's a revolution, throw your hands up
'cause we never gave in
and we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
hallelujah i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna go there anymore
and i know all the steps up to your door
but i don't wanna go there anymore

[pre-chorus]
talk to the wind, talk to the sky
talk to the man with the reasons why
and let me know what you find

[chorus]
i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night to call your name
just know i'm right here hoping
that you'll come in with the rain

[verse 2]
i could stand up and sing you a song
but i don't wanna have to go that far
and i, i've got you down, i know you by heart
and you don't even know where i start

[pre-chorus]
talk to yourself, talk to the tears
talk to the man who put you here
and don't wait for the sky to clear

[chorus]
i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night to call your name, oh

that you'll come in with the rain

[bridge]
i've watched you so long, screamed your name
i don't know what else i can say

[chorus]
i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night for all these games
just know i'm right here hoping
that you'll come in with the rain

[outro]
i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna go there anymore hey, i knew i'd run into you somewhere
it's been a while, i didn't mean to stare
i heard she's nothin' like me
i'm sure she'll make you happy

[chorus]
but don't you, don't you
smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you say you've
missed me if you don't want me again
you don't know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you, don't you?

[post-chorus]
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah

[verse 2]
sometimes, i really wish that i could hate you
i've tried, but that's just somethin' i can't do
my heart knows what the truth is
i swore i wouldn't do this

[chorus]
but don't you, don't you
smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you say you've
missed me if you don't want me again
you don't know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you, don't you?

[bridge]
so i'll walk out of here tonight
try to go on with my life
and you can say we're still friends
(but i don't wanna pretend)
so if i see you again

[chorus]
don't you (don't you), don't you
smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you (don't you) say you've

so why don't you, don't you?

[outro]
ah, ah, ah, ah
don't you (ah, ah, ah) there's something 'bout the way
the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot, yeah
oh, yeah

[verse 2]
we're driving down the road, i wonder if you know
i'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
absent-mindedly making me want you

[chorus]
and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fеarless

[verse 3]
so, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this onе-horse town
i wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now, capture it, remember it

[chorus]
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless
oh, oh

[bridge]
well, you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake, i'm not usually this way but
you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
it's fearless
oh, yeah

[chorus]
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless

[outro]
oh, oh
oh-oh, yeah you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the mornin' of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""you know, i haven't seen you around before""

[chorus]
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
well, count to ten, take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
at fifteen

[verse 2]
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough, you're best friends
laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be outta here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feelin' like flyin'
and your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
and you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends

[chorus]
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin around, well
in your life you'll do things greater than
datin' the boy on the football team
i didn't know it at fifteen

[bridge]
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then, i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had
to a boy who changed his mind
and we both cried

[chorus]
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
but i've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen
[post-chorus]
la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
la-la-la, la-la-la

[outro]
your very first day
take a deep breath, girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding?
'cause it seems to me
this thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby, what happened? please tell me
'cause one second it was perfect
now you're halfway out the door

[chorus]
and i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always""
oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, ""forever and always""

[verse 2]
was i out of line?
did i say something way too honest, made you run and hide
like a scared little boy?
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute, now i'm not so sure
so here's to everything coming down to nothing
here's to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going?
thought i knew for a minute, but i don't anymore

[chorus]
and i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always""
oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, ""forever and always""
you didn't mean it baby, i don't think so

[bridge]
oh, back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?
back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?

[chorus]
'cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, ""forever and always""
oh, i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said, ""forever and always""
and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, ""forever and always""
[outro]
you didn't mean it baby
you said, ""forever and always,"" yeah mmm-mm, mm-mm
mmm-mm, mm-mm
mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

[verse 1]
hey stephen, i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you
and as we walked we were talking
i didn't say half the things i wanted to
of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
hey stephen, boy, you might have me believing
i don't always have to be alone

[chorus]
'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain, so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself

[verse 2]
hey stephen, i've been holding back this feeling
so i've got some things to say to you (huh)
i've seen it all, so i thought
but i never seen nobody shine the way you do
the way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
it's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
hey stephen, why are people always leaving?
i think you and i should stay the same

[chorus]
'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain, so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself

[bridge]
they're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
why aren't you here tonight?
i'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
and pull me near and shine, shine, shine
hey stephen, i could give you fifty reasons
why i should be the one you choose
all those other girls, well, they're beautiful
but would they write a song for you? (ha-ha-ha)

[chorus]
i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain, so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself
if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain, so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself

oh-oh-oh
mmm-mm, mm-mm
mmm-mm, mm-mm
mmm-mm, mm-mm i like the way you sound in the mornin'
we're on the phone and without a warnin'
i realize your laugh is the best sound
i have ever heard
i like the way i can't keep my focus
i watch you talk, you didn't notice
i hear the words, but all i can think is
""we should be together""

[pre-chorus]
every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i'll shine for you

[chorus]
woah-oh, i'm feelin' you, baby
don't be afraid to jump, then fall
jump, then fall into me
baby, i'm never gonna leave you
say that you wanna be with me too
'cause i'ma stay through it all
so, jump, then fall

[verse 2]
huh, well, i like the way your hair falls in your face
you got the keys to me, i love each freckle on your face, oh
i've never been so wrapped up, honey
i like the way you're everything i ever wanted
i had time to think it oh-over
and all i can say is, ""come closer""
take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me

[pre-chorus]
'cause every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i'll shine for you

[chorus]
woah-oh, i'm feelin' you, baby

[bridge]
the bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
i'll catch you, i'll catch you
when people say things that bring you to your knees
i'll catch you
the time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
but i'll hold you through the night until you smile

[chorus]
woah-oh, i need you, baby

[outro]
every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i'll shine
and every time you're here
baby, i'll show you, i'll show you
you can jump, then fall, jump, then fall
jump, then fall into me, into me, yeah we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say, ""hello""
little did i know

[pre-chorus]
that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said, ""stay away from juliet""
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, ""please don't go,"" and i said

[chorus]
romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, ""yes""

[verse 2]
so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[pre-chorus]
'cause you were romeo, i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said, ""stay away from juliet""
but you were everything to me
i was begging you, ""please don't go,"" and i said

[chorus]
romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, ""yes""
romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult, but it's real
don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story, baby, just say, ""yes""

[post-chorus]
oh, oh

[bridge]
but i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town

[chorus]
and i said, ""romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you, but you never come
is this in my head? i don't know what to think""
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
it's a love story, baby, just say, 'yes'""
[outro]
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
'cause we were both young when i first saw you mr. ""perfect face""
mr. ""here to stay""
mr. ""looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away""
everything was right
mr. ""i've been waitin' for you all my life""
mr. ""every single day until the end, i will be by your side""

[pre-chorus]
but that was when i got to know mr. ""change of heart""
mr. ""leaves me all alone,"" i fall apart
it takes everything in me just to get up each day
but it's wonderful to see that you're okay

[chorus]
hello, mr. ""perfectly fine""
how's your heart after breakin' mine?
mr. ""always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
hello, mr. ""casually cruel""
mr. ""everything revolves around you""
i've been miss misery since your goodbye
and you're mr. ""perfectly fine""

[verse 2]
mr. ""never told me why""
mr. ""never had to see me cry""
mr. ""insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy""
he goes about his day
forgets he ever even heard my name
well, i thought you might be different than the rest, i guess you're all the same

[pre-chorus]
'cause i hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
i've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
and i never got past what you put me through
but it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

[chorus]
hello, mr. ""perfectly fine""
how's your heart after breakin' mine?
mr. ""always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
hello, mr. ""casually cruel""
mr. ""everything revolves around you""
i've been miss misery since your goodbye
and you're mr. ""perfectly fine""

[verse 3]
so dignified in your well-pressed suit
so strategized, all the eyes on you
sashay your way to your seat
it's the best seat, in the best room
oh, he's so smug, mr. ""always wins""
so far above me in every sense
so far above feeling anything

[bridge]
and it's really such a shame
it's such a shame
'cause i was miss ""here to stay""
now i'm miss ""gonna be alright someday""
and someday maybe you'll miss me
but by then, you'll be mr. ""too late""
[chorus]
goodbye, mr. ""perfectly fine""
how's your heart after breakin' mine?
mr. ""always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
goodbye, mr. ""casually cruel""
mr. ""everything revolves around you""
i've been miss misery for the last time
and you're mr. ""perfectly fine""

[outro]
you're perfectly fine
mr. ""looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away""
you said you'd never go away this is wrong but i can't help but feel like
there ain't nothing more right, babe
misty morning comes again and i can't
help but wish i could see your face
i knew from the first note played
i'd be breaking all my rules to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
scream your name

[chorus]
so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""i can't keep my eyes off of you""
i'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph
to hang on my wall, superstar

[verse 2]
morning lonelinеss comes around when i'm not
dreaming about you
whеn my world wakes up today
you'll be in another town
and i knew when i saw your face
i'd be counting down the ways to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
scream your name

[chorus]
so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""i can't take my eyes off of you""
i'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph
to hang on my wall, superstar

[bridge]
you played in bars, you play guitar
i'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
and you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
every night from the radio

[chorus]
so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""i can't take my eyes off of you""
i'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph
to hang on my wall, superstar

[outro]
sweet, sweet superstar
superstar i took a chance, i took a shot
and you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not
you took a swing, i took it hard
and down here from the ground, i see who you are

[chorus]
i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me, then cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why

[verse 2]
well, you could write a book on
how to ruin someone's perfеct day
well, i get so confused and frustratеd
forget what i'm tryin' to say, oh

[chorus]
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me, then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why

[bridge]
why do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside?
why do you have to put down my dreams
so you're the only thing on my mind?

[chorus]
well, i'm sick and tired of your attitude
feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me and cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i've got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love, then you push me around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why, why
tell me why, oh

[outro]
i take a step back, i let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof
now you know you said, ""i know""
when i said, ""i need some time, need some space
to think about all of this""
and you watched me go
and i knew my words were hard to hear
and harder to ever take back

[pre-chorus: taylor swift]
and i said, ""when can i-i-i come back?""

[chorus: taylor swift, keith urban]
and you said, ""that's when
when i wake up in the morning
that's when, when it's sunny or storming
laughing, when i'm crying
and that's when i'll be waiting at the front gate
that's when, when i see your face
i'll let you in, and baby, that's when""
mm, mm

[verse 2: keith urban, taylor swift]
i said, ""i know""
when you said, ""i did you wrong, made mistakes
and put you through all of this"" (through all of this)
then through the phone
came all your tears
and i said, ""leave those all in our past""

[pre-chorus: keith urban]
and you said, ""when can i-i-i come back?""

[chorus: keith urban & taylor swift]
and i said, ""that's when
when i wake up in the morning
that's when, when it's sunny or storming
laughing, when i'm crying
and that's when i'll be waiting at the front gate
that's when, when i see your face
i'll let you in, and baby, that's when""

[bridge: taylor swift]
and you said, ""honestly
when you were gone
did you ever think of me?""
and i said

[chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & keith urban]
""that's when, when i woke up in the morning
that's when it was sunny or storming
laughing, when i was crying
and that's when you were waiting at the front gate
that's when, when i saw your face
you let me in, and baby, that's when""
[outro: taylor swift, taylor swift & keith urban]
that's when, when i wake up in the morning (yeah)
that's when, when it's sunny or storming
when i'm laughing, when i'm crying
(that's when i'll be waiting at the front gate)
that's when i miss you, that's when i want you
(that's when, when i see your face)
that's when i love you, that's when i'm five years old, it's getting cold, i've got my big coat on
i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, i run and run
past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
look now, the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[chorus]
i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
but i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today

[verse 2]
i'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
and we talk and window shop 'til i've forgotten all their names

[chorus]
i don't know who i'm gonna talk to now at school
but i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day with you today

[bridge]
i have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother
inside and out, he's better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run and i
had the best days with you

[verse 3]
there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
it's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[chorus]
now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
for staying back and watching me shine
and i didn't know if you knew
so i'm taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you today in the heat of the fight i walked away
ignorin' words that you were sayin'
tryna make me stay
i said, ""this time i've had enough""
and you've called a hundred times
but i'm not picking up

[pre-chorus]
'cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over
but if you look a little closer

[chorus]
i said, ""leave,"" but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
screamin', ""i'm in love with you""
wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

[verse 2]
me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
i keep goin' back over things we both said
and i remember the slamming door
and all the things that i misread

[pre-chorus]
oh, babe, if you know everything
tell me why you couldn't see
when i left, i wanted you to chase after me, yeah

[chorus]
i said, ""leave,"" but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
screamin', ""i'm in love with you""
wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

[bridge]
and i'll scream out the window
i can't even look at you
i don't need you but i do, i do, i do
i say, ""there's nothing you can say
to make this right again, i mean it, i mean it""
but what i mean is

[chorus]
i said, ""leave,"" but, baby, all i want is you
to stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
screamin', ""i'm in love with you""
wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door
[outro]
with your face and the beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carried me from your car up the stairs
and i broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
after everything and that little black dress
after everything i must confess, i need you he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear
and it's like i couldn't ask for anything better
he opens up my door, and i get into his car
and he says, ""you look beautiful tonight""
and i feel perfectly fine

[chorus]
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you

[verse 2]
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
he's close to my mother
talks business with my father
he's charming and endearing
and i'm comfortable

[chorus]
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you

[bridge]
he can't see the smile i'm faking
and my heart's not breaking
'cause i'm not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating
intoxicating, complicated
got away by some mistake, and now

[chorus]
i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
so in love that i acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you oh, oh
[outro]
woah, woah, oh-oh, oh
and that's the way i loved you, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, woah
never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you today was a fairytale, you were the prince
i used to be a damsel in distress
you took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale

[verse 1]
today was a fairytale, i wore a dress
you wore a dark gray t-shirt
you told me i was pretty when i looked like a mess
today was a fairytale

[pre-chorus]
time slows down
whenever you're around

[chorus]
well, can you feel this magic in the air?
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale

[verse 2]
today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
that takes me to another planet
every move you make, everything you say is right
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale, all that i can say
is now it's getting so much clearer
nothing made sense 'til the time i saw your face
today was a fairytale

[pre-chorus]
time slows down
whenever you're around, yeah

[chorus]
but can you feel this magic in the air?

[outro]
oh, oh, yeah, oh
today was a fairytale untouchable like a distant diamond sky
i'm reaching out and i just can't tell you why
i'm caught up in you, i'm caught up in you

[pre-chorus]
untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
and when you're close, i feel like coming undone

[chorus]
in the middle of the night, when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars spelling out your name
you got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
come on, come on, little taste of heaven
oh, oh

[verse 2]
it's half full and i won't wait here all day
i know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

[pre-chorus]
but you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
and now that you're close, i feel like coming undone

[chorus]
in the middle of the night, when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars spelling out your name
you got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
come on, come on, oh

i want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
you got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together

you got to come on, come on, oh
come on, come on
come on, come on, oh, oh, oh, oh
it's like a million little stars spelling out your name
they're spelling out your name, oh we used to walk along the streets
when the porch lights were shining bright
before i had somewhere to be
back when we had all night and we were happy
i do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
you threw your arms around my neck, back when i deserved it
and we were happy

[chorus]
when it was good, baby, it was good, baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy

[verse 2]
we used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
that's sorta how i feel right now
and goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

[chorus]
when it was good, baby, it was good, baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy
we were happy

[bridge]
oh, i hate those voices telling me i'm not in love anymore
but they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'cause we were happy
we were happy

[chorus]
when it was good, baby, it was good, baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm
and you were gonna marry me
and we were happy
we were happy
oh-oh-oh-oh
we were happy say you're sorry, that face of an angel
comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time
'cause i honestly believed in you

[pre-chorus]
holdin' on, the days drag on
stupid girl, i shoulda known, i shoulda known

[chorus]
that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to come around

[verse 2]
maybe i was naive, got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
well, my mistakе, i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have thе upper hand

[pre-chorus]
i had so many dreams about you and me
happy endings, well now i know

[chorus]
that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to come around

[bridge]
and there you are on your knees
beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
just like i always wanted
but i'm so sorry

[chorus]
'cause i'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
i'm gonna find someone someday
who might actually treat me well
this is a big world, that was a small town
there in my rearview mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to catch me now

[outro]
oh, woah, woah, woah
try and catch me now, oh
it's too late to catch me now once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
shouldn't i find a stain? but i never do
the way the tires turn stones on old county roads
they leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
you find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
but like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
you can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[chorus: taylor swift & maren morris]
i lived and i learned
had you, got burned
held out and held on
god knows, too long, and wasted time
lost tears, swore that i'd get out of here
but no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me

[verse 2: taylor swift, taylor swift & maren morris]
the best and worst day of june
was the one that i met you
with your hands in your pockets
and your ""don't you wish you had me?"" grin
well i did, so i smiled, and i melted like a child
now, every breath of air i breathe reminds me of then

[chorus: taylor swift & maren morris]
and i lived and i learned
had you, got burned
held out and held on
god knows, too long, and wasted time
lost tears, swore that i'd get out of here
but no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me

[instrumental break]

[chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & maren morris]
i lived and i learned
and found out what it was to turn around
and see that we
were never really meant to be
so i lied, and i cried
and i watched a part of myself die
'cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me

[outro: taylor swift, taylor swift & maren morris]
i've still got you all over me
still got you all over me you're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do
i'm in my room, it's a typical tuesday night
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
and she'll never know your story like i do

[pre-chorus]
'cause she wears short skirts, i wear t-shirts
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[chorus]
if you could see that i'm the onе who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you see?
you bеlong with me, you belong with me

[verse 2]
walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
hey, isn't this easy?
and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say you're fine, i know you better than that
hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[pre-chorus]
she wears high heels, i wear sneakers
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[chorus]
if you could see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you see?
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know, baby?
you belong with me, you belong with me

[bridge]
oh, i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry
i know your favorite songs
and you tell me 'bout your dreams
think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me

[chorus]
can't you see that i'm the one who understands you?
been here all along, so why can't you see?
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know, baby?
you belong with me, you belong with me
[outro]
you belong with me
have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me?
you belong with me all this time i was wasting hoping you would come around
i've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
and it's taken me this long, baby, but i've figured you out
and you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[chorus]
you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry
no, no, oh-oh

[verse 2]
you're looking so innocent, i might believe you if i didn't know
could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waiting in the cold
and you've got your sharе of secrets
and i'm tired of being last to know, oh
and now you're asking me to listen
'cause it's worked each time before

[chorus]
but you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry
no, no, oh-oh
you're not sorry
no, no, oh-oh

[bridge]
you had me crawling for you, honey
and it never would've gone away, no
you used to shine so bright, but i watched all of it fade

[chorus]
so you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
there's nothing left to beg for
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry
no, no, oh-oh
you're not sorry
no, no, oh-oh

you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well

[verse 3]
photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
and your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
you taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
and you were tossing me the car keys, ""fuck the patriarchy""
keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
and i was thinkin' on the drive down, ""any time now
he's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you
but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[pre-chorus]
and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to

[chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret, but i kept you like an oath
sacred prayer and we'd swear
to remember it all too well, yeah

[bridge]
well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
runnin' scared, i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
i'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'cause i remember it all, all, all
[verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well, but i'm in a new hell
every time you double-cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me, who was she?
a never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weepin' in a party bathroom
some actress askin' me what happened, you
that's what happened, you
you who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
and he said, ""it's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[verse 5]
time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still tryin' to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[chorus]
'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well
wind in my hair, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well
[verse 6]
and i was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""i'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones
i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'cause in this city's barren cold
i still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell
i remember it all too well

[outro]
just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
just between us, do you remember it all too well?
just between us, i remember it (just between us) all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there (i was there)
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there (oh)
down the stairs, i was there, i was there (i was there)
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it (all too well)
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it i walked through the door with you, the air was cold
but something 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[verse 2]
oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
we're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days

[pre-chorus]
and i know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
oh, oh, oh

[chorus]
'causе there we arе again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well

[verse 3]
photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
you taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

[pre-chorus]
and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to
[chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well, yeah

[bridge]
and maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up

'cause i remember it all, all, all

down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well what about your promises, promises?
what about your promises, promises, promises? no

[verse 1]
what a shame
didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
that you never should have made

[pre-chorus]
i'm here on the kitchen floor
you call, but i won't hear it
you said, ""no one else""
how could you do this, babe?

[chorus]
(what about your promises, promises?)
you really blew this, babe
we ain't getting through this one, babe
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe
(this is the last time, this is the last time)
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe
(what about your promises, promises, promises? no)

[verse 2]
what a waste
takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
and it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

[pre-chorus]
i break down every time you call
we're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
we said, ""no one else""
how could you do this, babe?

[chorus]
(oh, what about your promises, promises?)
you really blew this, babe
we ain't getting through this one, babe
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe
(this is the last time, this is the last time)
this is the last time i'll ever call you

[bridge]
since you admitted it (oh-oh), i keep picturin' (oh-oh)
her lips on your neck (oh-oh), i can't unsee it
i hate that because of you, i can't love you, babe
what a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
how could you do this, babe? (babe)

[chorus]
you really blew this, babe (babe)
we ain't getting through this one, babe (babe)
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe (babe)

(what about your promises, promises?) took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn't like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didn't get this song
but i do, i do

[verse 2]
i walked in, expecting you'd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you don't know how nice that is
but i do

[chorus]
and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
but on a wеdnesday in a café, i watched it begin again

[verse 3]
you said you nеver met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you don't know why
i'm coming off a little shy
but i do

[chorus]
but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
but on a wednesday in a café, i watched it begin again

[instrumental break]

[bridge]
and we walked down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches every single christmas
and i want to talk about that
and for the first time, what's past is past

[chorus]
'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
but on a wednesday in a café, i watched it begin again

[outro]
on a wednesday in a café, i watched it begin again i know i'm probably better off on my own
than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
and i see the permanent damage you did to me
never again, i just wish i could forget when it was magic

[pre-chorus]
i wish it wasn't 4am, standin' in the mirror
saying to myself, ""you know you had to do it""
i know the bravest thing i ever did was run

[chorus]
sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man

[verse 2]
i know i'm probably better off all alone
than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
and it was always on your terms, i waited on every careless word
hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning

[pre-chorus]
but your jealousy, oh, i can hear it now
talking down to me like i'd always be around
push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
oh, you never thought i'd run

[chorus]
sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man

[bridge]
i hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all i have
and i gave to you my best
and we both know you can't say that

[breakdown]
i wish you were a better man
i wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
we might still be in love if you were a better man
you would've been the one if you were a better man

[chorus]
sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
(sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again)
we might still be in love, if you were a better man
(but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man)
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
[outro]
we might still be in love if you were a better man
you would've been the one if you were a better man you said it in a simple way
4 a.m., the second day
how strange that i don't know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss, then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall

[pre-chorus]
i told myself, ""don't get attached""
but in my mind, i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you

[chorus]
and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here

[verse 2]
the delicate beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never would've played so nonchalant

[pre-chorus]
taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i can't help but wish you took me with you

[chorus]
and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in london today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here

[post-chorus]
oh, oh
oh, oh
oh, oh

[bridge]
this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you when you are worlds away

[breakdown]
in new york, be here
but you're in london, and i break down
'cause it's not fair that you're not around
[chorus]
this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here

[post-chorus]
oh, oh, i don't wanna miss you like this
oh, oh

[outro]
come back, be here
come back, be here you good to go?

[verse 1: taylor swift]
all i knew this morning when i woke
is i know something now
know something now i didn't before
and all i've seen since eighteen hours ago
is green eyes and freckles and your smile
in the back of my mind, making me feel like

[pre-chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & ed sheeran]
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you
know you, know you

[chorus: taylor swift & ed sheeran]
'cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming homе
all i know is a simple name
everything has changеd
all i know is you held the door
you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed

[verse 2: ed sheeran, taylor swift]
and all my walls stood tall, painted blue
but i'll take 'em down, take 'em down
and open up the door for you
and all i feel in my stomach is butterflies
the beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
takin' flight, making me feel like

[pre-chorus: taylor swift & ed sheeran]
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better

'cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home
all i know is a simple name
everything has changed
all i know is you held the door
you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed
[bridge: taylor swift & ed sheeran]
come back and tell me why
i'm feeling like i've missed you all this time
and meet me there tonight
and let me know that it's not all in my mind

[pre-chorus: taylor swift]
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you
know you, know you

[chorus: taylor swift & ed sheeran]
all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home
all i know is a simple name
everything has changed
all i know is you held the door
and you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed

[outro: taylor swift, taylor swift & ed sheeran]
all i know is we said hello
so dust off your highest hopes
all i know is pouring rain
and everything has changed
all i know is a new found grace
all my days, i'll know your face
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed he says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
he says, ""why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
he spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
he spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

[pre-chorus]
i call, just checkin' up on him
he's up, 3am, pacin'
he says, ""it's not just a phase i'm in""
my voice comes out beggin'

[chorus]
all this time, i didn't know
you were breakin' down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go

[verse 2]
he seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds
his laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
i pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead

[pre-chorus]
i call, just checkin' up on him
he's up, 5am, wasted
long gone, not even listening
my voice comes out screamin'

[chorus]
all this time, i didn't know
you were breakin' down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go

[bridge]
if i was standing there in your apartment
i'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
i'd say, ""i love you even at your darkest and
please, don't go""

[chorus]
i didn't know
you were breakin' down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go
[post-chorus]
(ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'll be your summer sun forever
(ooh, ooh, ooh) at 3am, pacin'
all this time, i didn't know
(ooh, ooh, ooh) at 5am, wasted
i'd be in pieces on the floor
forever winter if you go

[outro]
he says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
i say, ""believe in one thing, i won't go away"" don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that

[verse 1]
i don't even know her
but i feel a responsibility
to do what's upstanding and right
it's kinda like a code, yeah
and you've been getting closer and closer
and crossing so many lines

[pre-chorus]
and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
but, honey, i am no one's exception
this, i have previously learned

[chorus]
so don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, еverybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
and now you've got mе alone, and i say
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[verse 2]
i just wanna make sure
you understand perfectly
you're the kind of man who makes me sad
while she waits up
you chase down the newest thing
and take for granted what you have

[pre-chorus]
and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
and, yeah, i might go with it
if i hadn't once been just like her

[chorus]
so don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
and now you've got me alone, and i say
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[post-chorus]
oh-oh
oh-oh
[bridge]
call a cab, lose my number
you're about to lose your girl
call a cab, lose my number
let's consider this lesson learned

[chorus]
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that
wanna see you pick up your phone
and tell her you're coming home
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[outro]
it would be a fine proposition
if i hadn't once been just like her i was reminiscing just the other day
while having coffee all alone and, lord, it took me away
back to a first-glance feeling on new york time
back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light, go
yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
and that was the first day

[chorus]
and darling, it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

[verse 2]
spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big, wide city all to ourselves
wе block the noise with the sound of ""i need you""
and for thе first time, i had something to lose
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the story's got dust on every page
but, sometimes, i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd

[chorus]
'cause, darling, it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

[bridge]
tonight, i'm gonna dance
for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
tonight, i'm gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you

[chorus]
it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

[outro]
tonight, i'm gonna dance
for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
tonight, i'm gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you i bet this time of night, you're still up
i bet you're tired from a long hard week
i bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
looking out at the city, and i bet
sometimes you wonder 'bout me

[chorus]
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do
i almost do

[verse 2]
i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
'cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
i bet it never, ever occurred to you
that i can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

[chorus]
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do
i almost do

[bridge]
oh, we made quite a mess, babe
it's probably better off this way
and i confess, baby
in my dreams, you're touching my face
and asking me if i wanna try again with you
and i almost do

[chorus]
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do
i almost do

[outro]
i bet this time of night, you're still up
i bet you're tired from a long hard week
i bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
looking out at the city, and i hope
sometimes you wonder 'bout me 3 am and i'm still awake, i'll bet you're just fine
fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
and the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
and i'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

[verse 2: taylor swift]
well, i tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
and the book that just saved 'em that i hadn't heard of

[chorus: taylor swift & chris stapleton, taylor swift]
but now that we're done and it's over
i bet you couldn't believe
when you realized i'm harder to forget than i was to leave
and i bet you think about me

[verse 3: taylor swift]
you grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
glamorous, shiny, bright beverly hills
i was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

[verse 4: taylor swift & chris stapleton]
but you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
and you and i fell like an early spring snow
but reality crept in, you said we're too different
you laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

[chorus: taylor swift & chris stapleton, taylor swift]
mr. superior thinkin'
do you have all the space that you need?
i don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
and i bet you think about me

[post-chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & chris stapleton]
i bet you think about me, yes
i bet you think about me

[bridge: taylor swift & chris stapleton, taylor swift]
oh, block it all out
the voices so loud, sayin'
""why did you let her go?""
does it make you feel sad
that the love that you're lookin' for
is the love that you had?

[verse 5: taylor swift]
now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
scared not to be hip, scared to get old
chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

[chorus: taylor swift & chris stapleton, taylor swift]
but now that we're done and it's over
i bet it's hard to believe
but it turned out i'm harder to forget than i was to leave
and, yeah, i bet you think about me
[post-chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & chris stapleton]
i bet you think about me, yes
i bet you think about me

[outro: taylor swift, taylor swift & chris stapleton]
i bet you think about me when you're out
at your cool indie music concerts every week
i bet you think about me in your house
with your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
i bet you think about me when you say
""oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me""
i bet you think about me once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights, you got me alone
you found me, you found me
you found me-e-e-e-e
i guess you didn't care and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard, you took a step back
without me, without me
without me-e-e-e-e

[pre-chorus]
and he's long gone when he's next to me
and i realize the blame is on me

[chorus]
'cause i knew you were troublе when you walked in

[verse 2]
no apologies, he'll never see you cry
pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
you're drowning, you're drowning
you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
and now i see, now i see

[pre-chorus]
he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me, hey

'til you put me down, oh

'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble
'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble i know that you like me
and it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
and i became hypnotized
by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied

[pre-chorus]
but now, you're so far away and i'm down
feelin' like a face in the crowd
i'm reachin' for you, terrified

[chorus]
'cause you could be the one that i love
i could be the one that you dream of
a message in a bottle is all i can do
standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
you could be the one that i keep, and i
i could be the reason you can't sleep at night
a mеssage in a bottle is all i can do
standin' herе, hopin' it gets to you

[verse 2]
these days i'm restless
workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
but time moves faster
replayin' your laughter, disaster

[pre-chorus]
'cause now, you're so far away and i'm down
feelin' like a face in the crowd
i'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause

[chorus]
'cause you could be the one that i love
i could be the one that you dream of
a message in a bottle is all i can do
standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (it gets to you)
you could be the one that i keep, and i (ah)
i could be the reason you can't sleep at night (at)
a message in a bottle is all i can do
standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[bridge]
how is it in london? (london)
where were you while i'm wonderin' (wonderin')
if i'll ever see you again?
you could be the one that i love, mm-mm
and now i'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[chorus]
'cause you could be the one that i love (yeah, yeah)
i could be the one that you dream of (of)
a message in a bottle is all i can do
standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (it gets to you)
you could be the one that i keep, and i

[outro]
(love) you could be the one that i love
(love) you could be the one that i love
(love) my love
and now i'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you they tell you while you're young
""girls, go out and have your fun""
then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
criticize the way you fly
when you're soaring through the sky
shoot you down and then they sigh
and say, ""she looks like she's been through it""

[pre-chorus: taylor swift]
lord, what will become of me
once i've lost my novelty?

[chorus: taylor swift]
i've had too much to drink tonight
and i know it's sad, but this is what i think about
and i wake up in the middle of the night
it's like i can feel time moving
how can a person know everythin' at eighteen
but nothin' at twenty-two?
and will you still want me
when i'm nothing new?
[verse 2: phoebe bridgers]
how long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
when you can't blame it on my youth
and roll your eyes with affection
and my cheeks are growing tired
from turning red and faking smiles
are we only biding time 'til i lose your attention?

[pre-chorus: taylor swift, phoebe bridgers]
and someone else lights up the room (ah)
people love an ingénue (ah)

[chorus: phoebe bridgers, taylor swift]
i've had (i've had) too much to drink tonight
how did i go from growin' up to breaking down?
and i wake up (wake up) in the middle of the night
it's like i can feel time movin'
how can a person know everything at eighteen
but nothing at twenty-two?
and will you still want me
when i'm nothing new?

[bridge: taylor swift, both, phoebe bridgers]
i know someday i'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
the kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
she'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
i'll say i'm happy for her, then i'll cry myself to sleep
oh, woah, oh (oh)
oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (oh)

[chorus: taylor swift, phoebe bridgers, both]
i've had (i've had) too much to drink tonight
but i wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
i wake up (wake up) in the middle of the night
and i can feel time moving
how can a person know everything at eighteen
but nothing at twenty-two?
and will you still want me
will you still want me
will you still want me
when i'm nothing new? loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street
faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[chorus]
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone (woah)
forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red (red, red)
(red, red)
but loving him was red (red, red)
(red, red)

[verse 2]
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[chorus]
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone (woah)
forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red (red, red)
oh, red (red, red)
burning red (red, red)
(red, red)

[bridge]
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
burning, it was red

[chorus]
oh, losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone (woah)
forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
'cause loving him was red (red, red)
yeah, yeah, red (red, red)
oh, burning red (red, red)
(red, red)

[post-chorus]
and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (red, red)
comes back to me, burning red (red, red)
(red, red)
yeah, yeah (red, red)

[outro]
his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street i remember your bare feet down the hallway
i remember your little laugh
race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
i love you to the moon and back
i remember your blue eyes looking into mine
like we had our own secret club
i remember you dancing before bedtime
then jumping on me, waking me up
i can still feel you hold my hand, little man
and even the moment i knew
you fought it hard like an army guy
remember i leaned in and whispered to you

[chorus]
""come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years""

[verse 2]
i remember the drive home, when the blind hope
turned to crying and screaming, ""why?""
flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
about a beautiful boy who died
and it's about to be halloween, you could be anything
you wanted if you were still here
i remember the last day, when i kissed your face
and whispered in your ear

[chorus]
""come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
we'll just disappear
come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years""

[bridge]
what if i'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
and what if i kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
and what if i really thought some miracle would see us through?
what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[chorus]
come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years

[outro]
i remember your bare feet down the hallway
i love you to the moon and back one, two, three, four

[verse 1: taylor swift, taylor swift & ed sheeran]
give me the keys, i'll bring the car back around
we shouldn't be in this town
and my so-called friends, they don't know
i'd drive away before i let you go
so give me a reason and don't say no, no

[pre-chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & ed sheeran]
there's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where i wrote
""i'll wait for you""
there's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
take it with you

[chorus: taylor swift & ed sheeran]
and run like you'd run from the law
darling, let's run
run from it all
we can go where our eyes can take us
go where no one else is, run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run

[verse 2: ed sheeran, taylor swift & ed sheeran, taylor swift]
so you laugh like a child
and i'll sing like no one cares
no one to be and no one to tell
i could see this view a hundred times
pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
so give me a reason and don't say no, no

[pre-chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & ed sheeran]
and the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
since i gave it to you
there's a heart on your sleeve, i'll take it when i leave
and hold it for you

[chorus: taylor swift & ed sheeran]
and run like you'd run from the law
darling, let's run
run from it all
we can go like they're trying to chase us
go where no one else is, run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run

[bridge: ed sheeran, taylor swift]
there's been this hole in my heart
this thing was a shot in the dark
say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
and i'll hold onto you while we run
(and we run and we run and we run)
[chorus: taylor swift & ed sheeran, taylor swift]
like you'd run from the law
(and we run and we run and we run)
darling, let's run
(and we run and we run and we run)
run from it all
(and we run and we run and we run)
we can go where our eyes can take us
go where no one else is, run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, and we'll run long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
i stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

[chorus]
we had a beautiful, magic love there
what a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[verse 2]
in dreams, i meet you in warm conversation
and we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
and time is taking its sweet time erasing you
and you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

[chorus]
'cause wе had a beautiful, magic love therе
what a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[post-chorus]
woah, woah

[bridge]
distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
silence, the train runs off its tracks
kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
hang up, give up and for the life of us, we can't get back

[chorus]
a beautiful, magic love there
what a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
what we had, a beautiful, magic love there
what a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
we had a beautiful, magic love there
what a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair i said, ""oh my, what a marvelous tune""
it was the best night
never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight
like we're made of starlight

[verse 1]
i met bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
picks me up late one night
out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
can't remember what song it was playing whеn we walked in
the night wе snuck into a yacht club party
pretending to be a duchess and a prince

[chorus]
and i said, ""oh my, what a marvelous tune""
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight

[verse 2]
he said, ""look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
you'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""don't you see the starlight, starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?""

[chorus]
like, ""oh my, what a marvelous tune""
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight

[bridge]
ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
ooh-ooh, dancing with me
ooh-ooh, we could get married
have ten kids and teach them how to dream

[post-chorus]
(ooh, hoo, hoo)
(ooh, hoo, hoo)
(ooh, hoo, hoo)
(ooh, hoo, hoo)

[chorus]
oh my, what a marvelous tune
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight
[breakdown]
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
like starlight, starlight
like we dream impossible dreams

[outro]
don't you see the starlight, starlight?
don't you dream impossible things? i'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
or fades in time

[chorus]
and i never (never)
saw you comin'
and i'll never (never)
be the same

[verse 2]
you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannonball
now all we know is don't let go
we are alone, just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[pre-chorus]
so you were never a saint and i loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild

[chorus]
and i never (never)
saw you comin'
and i'll never (never)
be the same

[bridge]
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
you're my achilles heel
this is the golden age
of something good and right and real

[chorus]
and i never (never)
saw you comin'
and i'll never
be the same, oh
and i never (never)
saw you comin'
and i'll never (never)
(so you were never a saint and i loved in shades of wrong)
be the same (we learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
(but this love is brave and wild)
[outro]
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right i'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
i threw my phone across the room at you
i was expecting some dramatic turn away
but you stayed
this morning, i said we should talk about it
'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved
that's when you came in wearing a football helmet
and said, ""okay, let's talk""

[chorus]
and i said, ""stay, stay, stay""
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay

[verse 2]
before you, i'd only dated self-indulgent takers
who took all of their problems out on me
but you carry my groceries and now i'm always laughing
and i love you because you have given me

[chorus]
no choice but to stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[bridge]
you took the time to memorize me
my fears, my hopes and dreams
i just like hanging out with you
all the time
all those times that you didn't leave
it's been occurring to me
i'd like to hang out with you
for my whole life

[chorus]
stay
and i'll be loving you for quite some time
no one else is gonna love me when i get mad, mad, mad
so i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay

[outro]
that's so fun i find myself at your door
just like all those times before
i'm not sure how i got there
all roads they lead me here
i imagine you are home
in your room, all alone
and you open your eyes into mine
and everything feels better

[pre-chorus: both]
and right before your eyes
i'm breaking
no past, no reasons why
just you and me

[chorus: both]
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[verse 2: taylor swift]
you find yourself at my door
and just like all those times before
you wear your best apology
but i was there to watch you leave
and all the times i let you in
just for you to go again
disappear when you come back
everything is better

[pre-chorus: both]
and right before your eyes
i'm aching
no past, nowhere to hide
just you and me

[chorus: both]
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[bridge: taylor swift, gary lightbody, both]
this is the last time you tell me i've got it wrong
this is the last time i say, ""it's been you all along""
this is the last time i let you in my door
this is the last time, i won't hurt you anymore
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
[chorus: both, taylor swift, gary lightbody]
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye
this is the last time i'm asking you this (this is the last time i'm asking you this)
put my name at the top of your list (put my name at the top of your list)
this is the last time i'm asking you why (this is the last time i'm asking you why)
you break my heart in the blink of an eye (you break my heart)
[outro: both]
this is the last time i'm asking you, last time i'm asking you
last time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you, last time i'm asking you
last time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you, last time i'm asking you
last time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you, last time i'm asking you
last time i'm asking you this new to town with a made-up name
in the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
and the camera flashes make it look like a dream
you had it figured out since you were in school
everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
so overnight, you look like a sixties queen

[pre-chorus]
another name goes up in lights
like diamonds in the sky

[chorus]
and they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
but can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
oh, oh, oh

[verse 2]
and now, it's big black cars and riviera views
and your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
and they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
and all the young things line up to take your place

[pre-chorus]
another name goes up in lights
you wonder if you'll make it out alive

[chorus]
and they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh

[verse 3]
it was a few years later, i showed up here
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
how you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
chose the rose garden over madison square
and it took some time, but i understand it now

[pre-chorus]
'cause now my name is up in lights
but i think you got it right

[chorus]
let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh you should've been there
should've burst through the door
with that ""baby, i'm right here"" smile
and it would've felt like
a million little shining stars that just align
and i would've been so happy

[verse 2]
christmas lights glisten
i've got my eye on the door
just waiting for you to walk in
but the time is ticking
people ask me how i've been
as i comb back through my memory
how you said you'd be here
you said you'd be here

[chorus]
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all laughing
as i'm looking around the room
but therе was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knеw

[verse 3]
and the hours pass by
now i just wanna be alone
but your close friends always seem to know
when there's something really wrong
so they follow me down the hall
and there in the bathroom
i try not to fall apart
and the sinking feeling starts
as i say hopelessly
""he said he'd be here""

[chorus]
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all laughing
and asking me about you
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew

[bridge]
what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know?
and what do you do
when the one who means the most to you
is the one who didn't show?
[breakdown]
you should've been here
and i would've been so happy

[chorus]
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all standing around me, singing
""happy birthday to you""
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, i knew
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[outro]
you called me later
and said, ""i'm sorry i didn't make it""
and i said, ""i'm sorry, too""
and that was the moment i knew i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night

[verse 1]
and so it goes
every weekend, this same party
i never go alone
and i don't seem broken-hearted
my friends all say they know
everything i'm going through
i drive down different roads
but they all lead back to you

[pre-chorus]
'cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
they weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
didn't read the note on the polaroid picture
they don't know how much i miss you

[chorus]
i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night

[verse 2]
and so it was
we never saw it comin'
not trying to fall in love
but we did like children runnin'
back then, we didn't know
we were built to fall apart
we broke the status quo
then we broke each other's hearts

[pre-chorus]
but don't forget about the night out in l.a
dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
no one knows about the words that we whispered
no one knows how much i miss you

[chorus]
i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night

[post-chorus]
take me away, take me away
take me away to you, to you
take me away, take me away
take me away to you, to you
[bridge]
i remember the night at the hotel
i was ridin' in the car when we both fell
i'm the one on the phone as you whisper
""do you know how much i miss you?""

[breakdown]
i wish that we could go back in time
and i'd say to you
""i miss you like it was the very first night""

[chorus]
i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night

[post-chorus]
take me away (take me), take me away (take me)
take me away (take me) to you, to you
take me away (take me), take me away (take me)
take me away (take me) to you, to you put your lips close to mine
as long as they don't touch
out of focus, eye to eye
'til the gravity's too much
and i'll do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and i'd be smart to walk away
but you're quicksand

[chorus]
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i-i-i like it

[verse 2]
i can't decide if it's a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow
but you're friction

[chorus]
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
i-i-i like it

[bridge]
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you a, get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home

[chorus]
this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
i-i-i, i-i-i, i-i-i - 

[bridge]
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you a, get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i will follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home
[outro]
this slope is treacherous
i-i-i like it i remember when we broke up
the first time, sayin', ""this is it, i've had enough""
'cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
when you said you needed space (what?)
then you come around again and say
""baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change""
""trust me,"" remember how that lasted for a day?
i say, ""i hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""i love you""

[pre-chorus]
ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
we called it off again last night, but
ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
this time, i'm telling you, i'm telling you

[chorus]
we are never, evеr, ever getting back togеther
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[post-chorus]
like, ever

[verse 2]
i'm really gonna miss you picking fights
and me falling for it, screaming that i'm right
and you would hide away and find your peace of mind
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[pre-chorus]
ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
you called me up again tonight, but
ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
this time, i'm telling you, i'm telling you

[chorus]
we (we) are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[post-chorus]
ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
oh

[bridge]
i used to think that we were forever, ever
and i used to say, ""never say never""
ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""i still love you""
and i'm, like, i'm just, i mean, this is exhausting, you know?
like, we are never getting back together
like, ever (no)
[chorus]
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[outro]
we (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
no, getting back together (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
we (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
oh, getting back together, yeah (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
Speak Now (Taylor’s Version),"i'm so glad you made time to see me
how's life? tell me, how's your family?
i haven't seen them in a while
you've been good, busier than ever
we small talk, work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why

[pre-chorus]
because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die

[chorus]
so, this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you sayin', ""i'm sorry for that night""
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time

[verse 2]
these days, i haven't been sleeping
stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
when your birthday passed and i didn't call
then i think about summer, all the beautiful times
i watched you laughin' from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall

[pre-chorus]
and then the cold came, the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye

[chorus]
so, this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin', ""i'm sorry for that night""
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time

[bridge]
i miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
so good to me, so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinkin'
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it, but i can't
so, if the chain is on your door, i understand

[chorus]
but this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin', ""i'm sorry for that night""
and i go back to december
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and make it alright
i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
[outro]
all the time now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (ha)
haha, time for a little revenge

[verse 1]
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
i had it all, i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say ""sabotage""
i never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with (oh)
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealin' from

[chorus]
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
he was a moth to the flame
she was holding the matches, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge (revenge), ha

[verse 2]
she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
that no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(think about what you did)

[chorus]
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
he was a moth to the flame
she was holding the matches, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge (haha)

[bridge]
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him, but haven't you heard?
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him, but i always get the last word
woah (come on, can you take it back? come on)

[chorus]
she's not a saint and she's not what you think (no)
she's an actress, woah (you know that you deserve this)
he was a moth to the flame
she was holding the matches, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge
[outro]
(come on) do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?
'cause i don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)
do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (no)
i don't think you do, i don't think you do
let's hear the applause (come on, come on)
come on, show me how much better you are (oh, oh)
(so much better, yeah?)
so you deserve some applause
'cause you're so much better
she took him faster than you could say ""sabotage"" (once, i had an empire)
(once, i had an empire)
(once, i had an empire)

[verse 1: taylor swift]
once, i had an empire in a golden age
i was held up so high, i used to be great
they used to cheer when they saw my face
now, i fear i have fallen from grace

[chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & hayley williams]
and i feel like my castle's crumbling down
and i watch all my bridges burn to the ground
and you don't want to know me, i will just let you down
you don't wanna know me now

[verse 2: hayley williams, taylor swift & hayley williams]
once, i was the great hope for a dynasty
crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
their faith was strong, but i pushed it too far
i held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

[pre-chorus: taylor swift & hayley williams, taylor swift]
power went to my head and i couldn't stop
ones i loved tried to help, so i ran them off
and here i sit alone behind walls of regret
falling down like promises that i never kept

[chorus: taylor swift & hayley williams, taylor swift]
and i feel like my castle's crumbling down
and i watch all my bridges burn to the ground
and you don't want to know me, i will just let you down
you don't wanna know me now

[bridge: taylor swift]
my foes and friends watch my reign end
i don't know how it could've ended this way
smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
people look at me like i'm a monster
now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
used to chant my name
now they're screaming that they hate me
never wanted you to hate me

[chorus: taylor swift, taylor swift & hayley williams]
my castle's crumbling down
and i watch all my bridges burn to the ground
and you don't want to know me, i will just let you down (just let you down)
my castle's crumbling down
you don't wanna know me now, now

[outro: taylor swift]
(once, i had an empire)
(once, i had an empire)
(once, i had an empire) long were the nights
when my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
prayin' the floor won't fall through again
and my mother accused me of losin' my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
then go back to turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you change the rules every day
wonderin' which version of you
i might get on the phone tonight
well, i stopped pickin' up
and this song is to let you know why

[chorus]
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i shoulda known

[verse 2]
well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love and take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
and i'll look back and regret how i ignored when they said
""run as fast as you can""

[chorus]
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john, i see it all now, it was wrong
don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
your dark, twisted games when i loved you so?
i shoulda known

[instrumental break]

[bridge]
you are an expert at ""sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'cause you burned them out
but i took your matches before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
oh

[chorus]
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress wrote you a song
you shoulda known
[outro]
you shoulda known
don't you think i was too young?
you shoulda known just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
i've got my money on things goin' badly
got a history of stories ending sadly
still hoping that the fire won't burn me
just one time, just one time

[chorus: taylor swift]
all i know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
and i want you now, wanna need you forever
in the heat of your electric touch, mmm

[verse 2: patrick stump, taylor swift & patrick stump]
i've been left in the rain lost and pining
i'm tryin' hard not to look like i'm trying
'cause every time i tried hard for love, it fell apart (woah)
i've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
i've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
still, i know that all it takes is to get it right
just one time, just one time

[chorus: taylor swift & patrick stump]
all i know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
and i want you now, wanna need you forever
in the heat of your electric touch, mmm

[bridge: taylor swift, patrick stump]
i was thinking just one time (just one time)
maybe the stars align (just one time)
and maybe i call you mine
and you won't need space
or string me along while you decide
and just one time (just one time)
maybe the moment's right (the moment's right)
it's 8:05 and i see two headlights

[chorus: both, taylor swift, patrick stump]
all i know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
got a feelin' your electric touch (ooh)
all i know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (life)
and i want you now, wanna need you forever
in the heat of your electric touch, mmm there i was again tonight
forcing laughter, faking smiles
same old tired, lonely place
walls of insincerity
shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you

[verse 2]
your eyes whispered, ""have we met?""
across the room, your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you

[chorus]
this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll spеnd forever wonderin' if you knеw
i was enchanted to meet you

[verse 3]
the lingering question kept me up
2am, who do you love?
i wonder 'til i'm wide awake
and now, i'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say
""hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
all i know is i was enchanted to meet you

[chorus]
this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you

[bridge]
this is me praying that
this was the very first page
not where the storyline ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you
please, don't be in love with someone else
please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
please, don't be in love with someone else (ooh)
please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (oh-oh)

[chorus]
this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
this night is flawless (please, don't be in love with someone else)
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck (please, don't have somebody waitin' on you)
dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever (please, don't be in love with someone else)
wonderin' if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
[outro]
please, don't be in love with someone else
please, don't have somebody waitin' on you my cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
and chances are i will talk myself to sleep again
you give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
and i will block out these voices of reason in my head

[pre-chorus]
and the voices say, ""you are not the exception
you will never learn your lesson""

[chorus]
foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will take the long way, you will take the long way down

[verse 2]
you know how to keep me waitin'
i know how to act like i'm fine
don't know what to call this situation
but i know i can't call you mine
and it's delicate, but i will do my best to seem bulletproof
'cause when my head is on your shoulder
it starts thinkin' you'll come around
and maybe, someday, when we're older
this is something we'll laugh about
over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news

[pre-chorus]
but then the voices say, ""you are not the exception
you will never learn your lesson""

[chorus]
foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will take the long way, you will take the long way down
foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out

[bridge]
now i'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
sayin', ""how could i not see the signs?""
oh, you haven't written me or called
but goodbye screamin' in the silence
and the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
i'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
and you will say you had the best of intentions
and maybe i will finally learn my lesson

[chorus]
foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will take the long way, you will take the long way down
foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh
[outro]
la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
la-la-la-la-la
ain't never gonna come
ooh, you will learn the hard way now
foolish one
sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
they ain't never gonna come
and thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
foolish one
the day is gonna come for your confessions of love
when all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
no, he just wasn't the one you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought i'd live to see it break
it's getting dark and it's all so quiet
and i can't trust anything now
and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[pre-chorus]
oh, holding my breath
won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold

[chorus]
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted

[verse 2]
stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time, i'm wishing he was you instead

[pre-chorus]
oh, holding my breath
won't see you again
something keeps me holding onto nothing

[chorus]
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
i can't turn back now, i'm haunted

[bridge]
i know, i know
i just know
you're not gone
you can't be gone, no

[chorus]
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong (terribly wrong)
won't finish what you started
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
i can't go back, i'm haunted
[outro]
oh
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break
never thought i'd see it i-i-i-i

[verse 1]
you brush past me in the hallway
and you don't think i, i, i can see ya, do ya?
i've been watchin' you for ages
and i spend my time tryin' not to feel it

[pre-chorus]
but what would you do if i went to touch you now?
what would you do if they never found us out?
what would you do if we never made a sound?

[chorus]
'cause i can see you waitin' down the hall from me
and i could see you up against the wall with me
and what would you do? baby, if you only knew
that i can see you

[post-chorus]
i-i-i-i

[verse 2]
and we kept everything professional
but something's changed, it's somethin' i, i like
they keep watchful eyes on us
so it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
you won't believe half the things i see inside my head
wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet

[pre-chorus]
but what would you do if i went to touch you now?
what would you do if they never found us out?
what would you do if we never made a sound?

[chorus]
'cause i can see you waitin' down the hall from me
and i could see you up against the wall with me
and what would you do? baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
that i could see you throw your jacket on the floor
i could see you, make me want you even more
what would you do? baby, if you only knew
that i can see you

[post-chorus]
i-i-i-i

[bridge]
i can see you in your suit and your necktie
passed me a note sayin', ""meet me tonight""
then we kiss and you know i won't ever tell, yeah
and i could see you being my addiction
you can see me as a secret mission
hide away and i will start behaving myself

[pre-chorus]
i-i-i-i
oh-oh, oh, oh
[chorus]
i can see you waitin' down the hall from me
and i could see you up against the wall with me
and what would you do? baby, if you only knew, oh
that i could see you throw your jacket on the floor
i could see you, make me want you even more
what would you do? baby, if you only knew
that i can see you, oh, i can see you

[outro]
oh, i see you, i see you, baby
i see you
(i-i-i-i) i see you, i see you, baby
oh, baby i guess you really did it this time
left yourself in your war path
lost your balance on a tightrope
lost your mind tryin' to get it back

[pre-chorus]
wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
always a bigger bed to crawl into
wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
and everybody believed in you?

[chorus]
it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
you're still an innocent

[verse 2]
did some things you can't speak of
but at night, you live it all again
you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then

[pre-chorus]
wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
when everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down to you
wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you?

[chorus]
it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
thirty-two and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent

[bridge]
time turns flames to embers
you'll have new septembers
every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
minds change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new
oh, oh

[chorus]
it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
thirty-two and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent
you're still an innocent
[outro]
lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
it's never too late to get it back i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 1:58
the words that you whispered for just us to know
you told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
away
i do recall now, the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement, i ran off the plane
that july ninth, the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt, i can still feel your arms

[pre-chorus]
but now i'll go
sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be somethin' you miss

[chorus]
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips

[verse 2]
i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party, you're showin' off again
and i'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
i'm not much for dancin', but for you, i did
because i love your handshake meetin' my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you'd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions

[pre-chorus]
and i'll go
sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be somethin' you miss

[chorus]
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm

[bridge]
so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are

[verse 3]
and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in the weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind

[pre-chorus]
so i'll go
sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be somethin' you miss
[chorus]
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips

[outro]
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last i said, ""remember this moment""
in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in stands went wild
we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew our lives
would never be the same
you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age

[chorus]
long live the walls we crashеd through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was scrеaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered

[verse 2]
i said, ""remember this feeling""
i pass the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
wishin' for right now
we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town
and the cynics were outraged
screaming, ""this is absurd""
'cause for a moment, a band of thieves
in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[chorus]
long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
and bring on all the pretenders, i'm not afraid
long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
i was screaming, ""long live that look on your face""
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered

[bridge]
hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall
will you take a moment? promise me this
that you'll stand by me forever
but if, god forbid, fate should step in
and force us into a goodbye
if you have children some day
when they point to the pictures
please, tell 'em my name
tell 'em how the crowds went wild
tell 'em how i hope they shine
long live the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life with you
[chorus]
long, long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
and i was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
and bring on all the pretenders, i'm not afraid
singing, ""long live all the mountains we moved""
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
and long, long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered you, with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feelin' like a nothing
you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i'm wounded
you, pickin' on the weaker man

[pre-chorus]
well, you can take me down
with just one single blow
but you don't know what you don't know

[chorus]
someday, i'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?

[verse 2]
you, with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i don't already see them
i walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again

[pre-chorus]
i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
'cause you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know what you don't know

[chorus]
someday, i'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?

[bridge]
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big, loud opinion, but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same ole bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing
but all you are is mean

[buildup]
all you are is mean
and a liar, and pathetic
and alone in life, and mean
and mean, and mean, and mean
[chorus]
but someday, i'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
someday, i'll be livin' in a big ole city
(why you gotta be so mean?)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
(why you gotta be so mean?)
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(why you gotta be so mean?)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean? ah-ah, ah-ah
ah-ah, ah-ah

[verse 1]
you were in college working part-time, waiting tables
left a small town, never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

[pre-chorus]
i say, ""can you believe it?""
as we're lying on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes, yes, i can see it now

[chorus]
do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine

[verse 2]
flash forward and we're taking on the world together
and there's a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded
you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[pre-chorus]
but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes, yes, this is what i thought about

[chorus]
do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water?
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine

[post-chorus]
oh-oh, oh

[bridge]
and i remember that fight, 2:30 am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
'cause it's all i've ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said, ""i'll never leave you alone"" (oh)
[chorus]
you said, ""i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you, it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine""

[post-chorus]
hold on, make it last
hold on, never turn back
(hold on) you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(hold on) you are the best thing that's ever been mine

[outro]
do you believe it? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
we're gonna make it now (yeah, yeah, yeah)
and i can see it (yeah, yeah)
i can see it now your little hand's wrapped around my finger
and it's so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
so i tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight

[pre-chorus]
to you, everything's funny
you got nothing to regret
i'd give all i have, honey
if you could stay like that

[chorus]
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you
won't let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up

[post-chorus]
and never grow up

[verse 2]
you're in the car, on the way to the movies
and you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
at fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

[pre-chorus]
but don't make her drop you off around the block
remember that she's gettin' older, too
and don't lose the way that you dance around
in your pjs getting ready for school

[chorus]
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
and no one's ever burned you
nothing's ever left you scarred
and even though you want to
just try to never grow up

[bridge]
take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps, remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is, someday, gonna be gone

[verse 3]
so, here i am in my new apartment
in a big city, they just dropped me off
it's so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
[chorus]
wish i'd never grown up
wish i'd never grown up
oh, i don't wanna grow up
wish i'd never grown up, i could still be little
oh, i don't wanna grow up
wish i'd never grown up, it could still be simple
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you (never grow up)
won't let no one break your heart
and even though you want to
please, try to never grow up

[outro]
oh, oh (never grow up)
just never grow up
oh (never grow up)
just never grow up elevator buttons and morning air
strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
if you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
but right now, my time is theirs
seems like there's always someone who disapproves
they'll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jury's out, but my choice is you

[chorus]
so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours

[verse 2]
you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
and you'll say

[chorus]
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours

[bridge]
and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

[chorus]
so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they can't take what's ours
they can't take what's ours
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and i'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
but i kinda know that i won't get far
and you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see what i was thinkin' of

[chorus]
drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

[verse 2]
my mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really somethin'
you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be
i'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you, i know it's no good
and i could wait patiently, but i really wish you would

[chorus]
drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

[bridge]
i'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
i'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show

[chorus]
drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk (ah-ah), take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

[outro]
and the sparks fly
oh, baby, smile
and the sparks fly i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

[pre-chorus]
this is surely not what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say

[chorus]
don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said, ""spеak now""

[verse 2]
fond gestures are еxchanged
and the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

[pre-chorus]
she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me, don't you?

[chorus]
don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said, ""speak now""
don't say yes, run away now (run away now)
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow (say a single vow)
your time is running out
and they said, ""speak now""

[post-chorus]
ooh (run away now), la
ooh (say a single vow), ooh

[bridge]
i hear the preacher say
""speak now or forever hold your peace""
there's the silence, there's my last chance
i stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but i'm only lookin' at you
[verse 3]
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

[chorus]
so, don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
they said, ""speak now""
and you say, ""let's run away now (run away now)
i'll meet you when i'm out
of my tux, at the back door
baby, i didn't say my vows (say a single vow)
so glad you were around
when they said, 'speak now'"" tall, dark, and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
it's the same thing to me
he's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say
and you smile and say, ""how are you?""
and i'll say, ""just fine""
i always forget to tell you, ""i love you""
i love you forever

[chorus]
i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
and i watch superman fly away
come back, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down

[verse 2]
tall, dark and beautiful
he's complicated, he's irrational
but i hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
he's not all bad like his reputation
and i can't hear one single word they say
and you'll leave, got places to be, and i'll be okay
i always forget to tell you, ""i love you""
i loved you from the very first day

[chorus]
i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
and i watch superman fly away
come back, i'll be with you someday

and i watch you fly around the world
and i hope you don't save some other girl

i'm far away, but i never let you go
i'm love-struck and looking out the window
don't forget, don't forget where i'll be

[breakdown]
right here, wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the call was from you
'cause i loved you from the very first day

[chorus]
i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
forever and ever

when you come back down i used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
how we met and the sparks flew instantly
and people would say, ""they're the lucky ones""
i used to know my place was the spot next to you
now i'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on

[pre-chorus]
oh, a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fallout
so many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up, i can't break through

[chorus]
now i'm standin' alone in a crowded room
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
like it's killin' me? yeah
i don't know what to say since thе twist of fate
when it all broke down
and thе story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[post-chorus]
next chapter

[verse 2]
how'd we end up this way?
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy
and you're doin' your best to avoid me
i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us
how i was losin' my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride like you should've held me

[pre-chorus]
oh, i'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothin'?
i'd tell you i miss you, but i don't know how
i've never heard silence quite this loud

[chorus]
now i'm standin' alone in a crowded room
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
like it's killin' me? yeah
i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[bridge]
this is looking like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but i liked it better when you were on my side
the battle's in your hands now
but i would lay my armor down
if you said you'd rather love than fight
[pre-chorus]
so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon

[chorus]
now i'm standin' alone in a crowded room

[outro]
the end down the block, there's an antique shop
and something in my head said, ""stop,"" so i walked in
on the counter was a cardboard box
and the sign said, ""photos: twenty-five cents each""
black and white, saw a 30s bride
and school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
the kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
the kind you don't put down

[pre-chorus]
and that's when i called you and it's so hard to explain
but in those photos, i saw us instead
and, somehow, i know that you and i would've found each other
in another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met

[chorus]
on a crowded street in 1944
and you werе headed off to fight in the war
you still would've been mine
we would have been timeless
i would've read your love letters every single night
and prayed to god you'd be comin' home all right
and you would've been fine
we would have been timeless
'cause i believe that we were supposed to find this
so, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
we would've been timeless

[verse 2]
i had to smile when it caught my eye
there was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
holdin' hands on the way to a dance
and the date on the back said 1958
which brought me back to the first time i saw you
time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
i thought about it as i started lookin' 'round
at these precious things that time forgot

[pre-chorus]
that's when i came upon a book covered in cobwebs
story of a romance torn apart by fate
hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
and i'd die for you in the same way if i first saw your face

[chorus]
in the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
and i was forced to marry another man
you still would've been mine
we would have been timeless
i would've read your love letters every single night
and run away and left it all behind
you still would've been mine
we would've been timeless
'cause i believe that we were supposed to find this
so, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
we would've been timeless
[bridge]
time breaks down your mind and body
don't you let it touch your soul
it was like an age-old classic
the first time that you saw me
the story started when you said, ""hello""

[chorus]
in a crowded room a few short years ago
and sometimes there's no proof, you just know
you're always gonna be mine
we're gonna be
i'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
we'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
and you'll say, ""oh my, we really were timeless""

[post-chorus]
we're gonna be timeless, timeless
you still would've been mine
we would've been
even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
you still would've been mine
we would've been

down the block, there's an antique shop
and somethin' in my head said, ""stop,"" so i walked in when emma falls in love, she paces the floor
closes the blinds and locks the door
when emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
she waits and takes her time
'cause little miss sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
when emma falls in love, i know
that boy will never be the same

[chorus]
'cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
like if cleopatra grew up in a small town
and all the bad boys would be good boys
if they only had a chance to love her
and to tell you the truth, sometimes i wish i was her

[verse 2]
when emma falls in love, it's all on her face
hangs in the air like stars in outer space
when emma falls in love, she disappears
and we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
when emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
she takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'cause when emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
she won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

[chorus]
and she's the kind of book that you can't put down
like if cleopatra grew up in a small town

and to tell you the truth, sometimes i wish i was her

[bridge]
well, she's so new york when she's in l.a.  
she won't lose herself in love the way that i did
'cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
when emma falls in love, i'm learning

[verse 3]
emma met a boy with eyes like a man
turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
now he'll be her shelter when it rains
little does he know, his whole world's about to change

[chorus]
'cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down

The More Fearless (Taylor’s Version) Chapter,"last night, i heard my own heart beatin'
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and i'm still reachin'
even though i know you're not there
i was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
maybe i've been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you

[chorus]
come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

[verse 2]
i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'cause nothing like this ever happened to them
now i'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me
nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
back before i knew how much i had to lose

come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
